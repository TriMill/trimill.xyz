Oh dear, what is this? The first post in a "blog", perhaps? 

Blog is a rather interesting word. It comes from a shortening of "weblog", web + log, where "web" refers to the interconnected structure of the Internet and "log" is itself a shortening of "logbook", a book used to record readings from a "chip log", a piece of wood used to measure the speed of a ship. In this way, "blog" is really a shortening of "weblogbook".

I am currently writing this post in Markdown, which will be converted into HTML so it can be viewed in browsers. I wonder how formatting looks? **bold**. *italic*. ~~strikethrough~~. `code`. Interesting.

This concludes the test post.
