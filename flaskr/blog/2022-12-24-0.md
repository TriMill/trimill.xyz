Pie.

I have heard many people answer this question with "pizza". I understand the spirit of this answer; there are nearly endless permutations of pizza toppings, one could easily eat a different pizza for every meal of ones life without repeat.[^1] 

What these people forget is that pizza is, in fact, a subset of pie. By broadening the answer to pie, we include all pizzas as well as all other kinds of pies. Much like pizzas, there are many different kinds of pies appropriate for various occasions: dessert pies, meat or vegetable pies, and quiches, to name a few. 

If you are not happy with preexisting pies, it is quite simple to innovate an entirely new pie. Simply construct a rigid, breadlike crust and fill it with arbitrary other foodstuffs (including at least one liquidious or saucy food, to bind the others together). Ideally, these ingredients would taste good in combination.

With pie, the possibilities are endless.

[^1]: [this list](https://thepizzacalc.com/pizza-toppings-list-4/) includes 80 standard pizza toppings. this yields $2^{80}$ possible pizzas. if a human lives for 100 years and eats 3 meals per day, they will eat about 110,000 meals, which is far less than $2^{80}$.
