My favorite number is 12. Some people I have talked to do not understand the concept of a favorite number, so in this post I will attempt to justify why 12 is mine.

- 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12), which is more factors than any positive integer less than it.
- The dodecahedron, one of the five platonic solids (and the only one to have pentagonal faces), has 12 faces. The cube (the only platonic solid with square faces) has 12 edges.
- Base 12 is a very good positional number system, much more practical than base 10 (although not as good as base 6)
- The Riemann zeta function evaluated at -1 is equal to $$ \frac{-1}{12} $$
- i like it :)
