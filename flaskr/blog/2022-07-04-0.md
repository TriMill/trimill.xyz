![citrons: "we should have a unified GEORGE RSS feed that combines all of the RSS feeds in GEORGE"](/static/i/blog/rssb_origins.png)

When this idea was brought up a few months ago, I stated in response that I would pursue it at a later date if no one else had (possibly). Recently, that later date has occured. 

RSS Bundler is a program that reads from multiple RSS feeds, merges them into one, and serves the resulting feed using an embedded HTTP server. The source code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/TriMill/rss-bundler). The aforementioned GEORGE RSS bundle is available [here](https://api.trimill.xyz/george-bundle/rss.xml).
